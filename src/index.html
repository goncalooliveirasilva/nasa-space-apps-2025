          <p>
            A series of coordinated polar-orbiting satellites that monitor
            Earth's climate and atmospheric conditions. EOS missions focus on
            some climate science areas: atmospheric composition, carbon cycle,
            ecosystems and biochemistry, climate variability and change, water
            and energy cycles, weather, and Earth surface and interior. The
            three satellites that compose the EOS are: Terra, Aqua, and Aura.

          Launched in 1999, this is the <strong>first</strong> of the three EOS
          satellites. It follows a Sun-synchronous orbit(it's always "facing"
          the sun at the same angle) around the Earth at an altitude of around
          705km. It comes equipped with 5 sensors that monitor different aspects
          of the environment on Earth:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>ASTER</strong>: creates high-resolution images of clouds,
            ice, water and the land surface.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CERES</strong>: measures solar-reflected and Earth-emitted
            radiations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MISR</strong>: measures the intensity of solar radiation
            reflected by the Earth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MODIS</strong>: monitors Earth's atmosphere, oceans and
            land, tracking things like vegetation and changes in landscape and
            water levels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MOPITT</strong>: measures the carbon monoxide levels in the

          This is the second satellite launched in the EOS program, launched in
          2002. Its purpose is to study precipitation, evaporation and water in
          general. It was in a special formation with other satellites
          (including Aura) called "A-train", but has since left it in 2022
          following fuel complications. Its now in free-drift mode.

          focuses on studying the Earth's air quality and ozone layer. In a
          similar vein to Aqua, it followed the "A-train" formation with other
          satellites, but has been drifting since 2023 for fuel saving purposes.

        <h2>What is Carbon Monoxide?</h2>
        <p>
          Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas produced whenever
          carbon-based fuels — such as gasoline, wood, natural gas, or coal — do
          not burn completely. In the atmosphere, CO plays an important role in
          air chemistry and climate processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Near the ground, carbon monoxide contributes to the formation of
          ground-level ozone, a key component of smog that affects both air
          quality and human health. High concentrations of CO reduce the amount
          of oxygen that can be carried by the blood, leading to health effects
          such as headaches, dizziness, and, at very high levels, even death.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the upper atmosphere, CO acts as a tracer for studying how air
          masses move and mix. By tracking CO from sources like wildfires, urban
          emissions, and biomass burning, scientists can better understand how
          pollution is transported across regions and how it interacts with
          greenhouse gases.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>MOPITT</strong> instrument on NASA’s
          <strong>Terra satellite</strong> continuously measures global CO
          levels in the troposphere, helping researchers monitor changes in air
          quality and the long-range transport of pollutants.
